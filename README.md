# Snyk Starter Open Source Workshop

Snyk is an open source security platform designed to help software-driven businesses enhance developer security. Snyk's dependency scanner makes it the only solution that seamlessly and proactively finds, prioritizes and fixes vulnerabilities and license violations in open source dependencies

Snyk's GitHub integration allows developers to easily onboard their GitHub repositories to scan and continuously monitor them for open source security and license risks. This integration also enables Snyk's Automated Fix Pull Requests and adds Snyk checks on every Pull Request.

In this **hands-on** demo we will achieve the follow

* Fork the highly vulnerable Goof Application
* Configure GitHub Integration
* Find vulnerabilities
* Fix using a Pull Request
* Test using the CLI (test and monitor)
* Failing using Exit Codes
* Viewing Dashboard Reports
* IDE integration VS Code
